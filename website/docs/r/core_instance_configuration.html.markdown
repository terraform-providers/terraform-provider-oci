			* `are_legacy_imds_endpoints_disabled` - (Optional) Whether to disable the legacy (/v1) instance metadata service endpoints. Customers who have migrated to /v2 should set this to true for added security. Default is false. 
		* `ipxe_script` - (Optional) This is an advanced option.

			When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.

			If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

			The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

			For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see [Bring Your Own Image](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm).

			* Provide information to [Cloud-Init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to be used for various system initialization tasks.
			* Get information about the instance, including the custom metadata that you provide when you launch the instance.

			**Providing Cloud-Init Metadata**

			You can use the following metadata key names to provide information to Cloud-Init:

			**"ssh_authorized_keys"** - Provide one or more public SSH keys to be included in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the default user on the instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The SSH keys must be in the format necessary for the `authorized_keys` file, as shown in the example below.

			**"user_data"** - Provide your own base64-encoded data to be used by Cloud-Init to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud-Init configuration.

An instance configuration defines the settings to use when creating Compute instances, including details such as the base image, shape, and metadata. You can also specify the associated resources for the instance, such as block volume attachments and network configuration.

	When you create an instance configuration using an existing instance as a template, the instance configuration does not include any information from the source instance's boot volume, such as installed applications, binaries, and files on the instance. It also does not include the contents of any block volumes that are attached to the instance.

	To create an instance configuration that includes the custom setup from an instance's boot volume, you must first create a custom image from the instance (see [CreateImage](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Image/CreateImage)). Then, use the custom image to launch a new instance (see [LaunchInstance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance)). Finally, create the instance configuration based on the instance that you created from the custom image.

	To include block volume contents with an instance configuration, first create a backup of the attached block volumes (see [CreateVolumeBackup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/VolumeBackup/CreateVolumeBackup)). Then, create the instance configuration by specifying the list of settings, using [InstanceConfigurationVolumeSourceFromVolumeBackupDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/datatypes/InstanceConfigurationVolumeSourceFromVolumeBackupDetails) to include the block volume backups in the list of settings.

	The following values are supported:
	* `NONE`: Creates an instance configuration using the list of settings that you specify.
	* `INSTANCE`: Creates an instance configuration using an existing instance as a template. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

			When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.

			If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

			The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

			For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see [Bring Your Own Image](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm).
