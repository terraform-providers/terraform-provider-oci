# Data Source: oci_core_images
This data source provides the list of Images in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Lists the available images in the specified compartment, including
[platform images](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm) and
[custom images](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingcustomimages.htm) that have
been created.

The list of images that's returned is ordered to first show all
platform images, then all custom images. The order of images might
change when new images are released.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_images" "test_images" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.image_display_name
	operating_system = var.image_operating_system
	operating_system_version = var.image_operating_system_version
	shape = var.image_shape
	state = var.image_state
	sort_by = var.image_sort_by
    sort_order = var.image_sort_order
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. 
* `operating_system` - (Optional) The image's operating system.  Example: `Oracle Linux` 
* `operating_system_version` - (Optional) The image's operating system version.  Example: `7.2` 
* `shape` - (Optional) Shape name. A filter to only return resources that are compatible with the given shape.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to only return resources that match the given lifecycle state.  The state value is case-insensitive. 
* `sort_by` - (Optional) Sort the resources returned, by creation time or display name. Example `TIMECREATED` or `DISPLAYNAME`.
* `sort_order` - (Optional) The sort order to use, either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`).

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `images` - The list of images.

### Image Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `agent_features` - Oracle Cloud Agent features supported on the image.
	* `is_management_supported` - This attribute is not used. 
	* `is_monitoring_supported` - This attribute is not used. 
* `base_image_id` - The OCID of the image originally used to launch the instance.
* `billable_size_in_gbs` - The size of the internal storage for this image that is subject to billing (1 GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes).  Example: `100` 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment containing the instance you want to use as the basis for the image. 
* `create_image_allowed` - Whether instances launched with this image can be used to create new images. For example, you cannot create an image of an Oracle Database instance.  Example: `true` 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name for the image. It does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

	You cannot use a platform image name as a custom image name.

	Example: `My custom Oracle Linux image` 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the image.
* `launch_mode` - Specifies the configuration mode for launching virtual machine (VM) instances. The configuration modes are:
	* `NATIVE` - VM instances launch with iSCSI boot and VFIO devices. The default value for platform images.
	* `EMULATED` - VM instances launch with emulated devices, such as the E1000 network driver and emulated SCSI disk controller.
	* `PARAVIRTUALIZED` - VM instances launch with paravirtualized devices using VirtIO drivers.
	* `CUSTOM` - VM instances launch with custom configuration settings specified in the `LaunchOptions` parameter. 
* `launch_options` - Options for tuning the compatibility and performance of VM shapes. The values that you specify override any default values. 
	* `boot_volume_type` - Emulation type for the boot volume.
		* `ISCSI` - ISCSI attached block storage device.
		* `SCSI` - Emulated SCSI disk.
		* `IDE` - Emulated IDE disk.
		* `VFIO` - Direct attached Virtual Function storage. This is the default option for local data volumes on platform images.
		* `PARAVIRTUALIZED` - Paravirtualized disk. This is the default for boot volumes and remote block storage volumes on platform images. 
	* `firmware` - Firmware used to boot VM. Select the option that matches your operating system.
		* `BIOS` - Boot VM using BIOS style firmware. This is compatible with both 32 bit and 64 bit operating systems that boot using MBR style bootloaders.
		* `UEFI_64` - Boot VM using UEFI style firmware compatible with 64 bit operating systems. This is the default for platform images. 
	* `is_consistent_volume_naming_enabled` - Whether to enable consistent volume naming feature. Defaults to false.
	* `is_pv_encryption_in_transit_enabled` - Deprecated. Instead use `isPvEncryptionInTransitEnabled` in [LaunchInstanceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/datatypes/LaunchInstanceDetails). 
	* `network_type` - Emulation type for the physical network interface card (NIC).
		* `E1000` - Emulated Gigabit ethernet controller. Compatible with Linux e1000 network driver.
		* `VFIO` - Direct attached Virtual Function network controller. This is the networking type when you launch an instance using hardware-assisted (SR-IOV) networking.
		* `PARAVIRTUALIZED` - VM instances launch with paravirtualized devices using VirtIO drivers. 
	* `remote_data_volume_type` - Emulation type for volume.
		* `ISCSI` - ISCSI attached block storage device.
		* `SCSI` - Emulated SCSI disk.
		* `IDE` - Emulated IDE disk.
		* `VFIO` - Direct attached Virtual Function storage. This is the default option for local data volumes on platform images.
		* `PARAVIRTUALIZED` - Paravirtualized disk. This is the default for boot volumes and remote block storage volumes on platform images. 
* `listing_type` - The listing type of the image. The default value is "NONE".
* `operating_system` - The image's operating system.  Example: `Oracle Linux` 
* `operating_system_version` - The image's operating system version.  Example: `7.2` 
* `size_in_mbs` - The boot volume size for an instance launched from this image (1 MB = 1,048,576 bytes). Note this is not the same as the size of the image when it was exported or the actual size of the image.  Example: `47694` 
* `state` - The current state of the image.
* `time_created` - The date and time the image was created, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).  Example: `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z`
